# State Transisition Function [Interacting with the state]


Stackr provides a comprehensive way to interact with your state. The state transition function is the only way to change the state.
It is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns the new state.

:::warning
Do not perform any side effects or network calls in the state transition
function. It is a pure function.

## Custom Action Types -> STF Input

:::info
These are inputs to the STF, the inputs from user are also similar though
:::

Stackr calls transactions as Actions because it does not limit you to the type of transactions you can build.
You are in-charge. You can define any custom action types you want.

Fun fact â€” "Actions" were called "UserIntents" in the initial versions of Stackr but then another definition of "Intents" came out.

## Defining Custom Action Types

```ts
export interface CounterActionInput {
  type: "increment" | "decrement";
}
```

This action expects objects of the type `{type: "increment"}` to be passed to the state transition function.

```ts
export interface TransferActionInput {
  type: "transfer";
  to: string;
  amount: number;
}
```

This action expects a transaction object of the type 
`{type: "transfer", to: "0x123", amount: 100}` 
to be passed to the state transition function.

Do not worry about signatures yet

## Defining the State Transition Function

oof, the big one. This is where you define how your state changes when an action is performed.

Stackr-JS comes with a `STF` interface that can be extended.

```ts
import { STF } from "@stackr/stackr-js/execution";

export const veryEfficientSTF: STF<RollupState, ActionInput>;
```

You need to pass the state and action input types to the `STF` interface.

## Extending the STF Interface

The `STF` interface has a single method `apply` that takes the input and an identifier.

There are THREE steps to build an STF.

#### 1. Get the current state

usually via `transport.getState()`

#### 2. modify the state based on the action input

update the state based on the action input, use "switch" or "if" statements based on input

#### 3. set the new state to the transport

### Example

:::code-group

```ts [simple]
export const counterSTF: STF<CounterRollup, CounterActionInput> = {
  identifier: "counterSTF",

  apply(inputs: CounterActionInput, state: CounterRollup): void {
    // step  1
    let newState = state.getState();

    // step 2
    if (inputs.type === "increment") {
      newState += 1;
    } else if (inputs.type === "decrement") {
      throw new Error("Not implemented");
    }

    // step 3
    state.transport.currentCount = newState;
  },
};
```

```ts [complex]
export const swapSTF: STF<DEXRollup, DEXActionInput> = {
  identifier: "swap",

  apply(inputs: DEXActionInput, state: DEXRollup): void {
    // step 1
    let newState = state.getState();

    const { type, quantity, owner } = inputs;
    const ownerObjIndex = newState.findIndex((order) => order.owner === owner);
    if (ownerObjIndex === -1) {
      throw new Error("Owner not found in state");
    }
    const ownerObj = newState[ownerObjIndex];

    // step 2

    if (type === "A") {
      if (ownerObj.quantityB < quantity) {
        throw new Error("Not enough tokens");
      }

      ownerObj.quantityA += quantity;
      ownerObj.quantityB -= quantity;
    } else if (type === "B") {
      if (ownerObj.quantityA < quantity) {
        throw new Error("Not enough tokens");
      }

      ownerObj.quantityB += quantity;
      ownerObj.quantityA -= quantity;
    } else {
      throw new Error("Invalid type");
    }

    // step 3
    newState[ownerObjIndex] = ownerObj;
    state.transport.allOrders = newState;
  },
};
```

## Future scope

Currently the SDK only supports a single STF and the various types are handled using a switch statement,
However in the future, the Micro-rollups will be able to accept multiple different STFs
