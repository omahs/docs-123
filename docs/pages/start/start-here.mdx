<Info>
  This section will guide you through the process of creating, compiling and
  deploying your first Micro-Rollup project. We will be using a ready-made
  template.

### Code-Camp

The idea of this section is to get you up and running with a simple project **without** diving deep into **how** stuff is working at this moment or **why** it needs to be done like that.
The detailed part will come on in later.

### Expectation Checklist

1. Make sure your system has all the dependencies installed.
2. Make sure you are able to create a new project and are able to work with the generated files.
3. Make sure you are able to register your rollup with an on-chain contract.
4. Make sure you are able to compile the State and STF without any errors.
5. Make sure you are able to sign the genesis state and deploy the project to the vulcan layer and the vulcan layer is able to correctly index and verify your state transitions.
