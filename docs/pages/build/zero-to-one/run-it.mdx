# Running a Micro-rollup

If you are using a template it might already have a micro-rollup setup. But a few things to make sure before running or deploying your micro-rollup are:
::::steps

### MicroRollup Setup

You have created an instance of `MicroRollup` and passed the necessary options.

### Configuration

You have passed the `stackrConfig` object exported from the `stackr.config.ts` file to the `MicroRollup` constructor like this

```ts showLineNumbers [index.ts]
const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig, // [!code focus]
  ...
});
```

### Action Registration

You have added all the `ActionSchema`s to the `MicroRollup` constructor like this

```ts showLineNumbers [index.ts]
const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [ActionSchema1, ActionSchema2, ...], // [!code focus]
  ...
});
```

### State Machine Registration

You have added the State Machine lazily to the micro-rollup, using

```ts showLineNumbers [index.ts]
const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [ActionSchema1, ActionSchema2, ...],
  stateMachines: [machine], // [!code focus]
  ...
});
```

### Initialization

You have started the micro-rollup using

```ts showLineNumbers [index.ts]
const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [ActionSchema1, ActionSchema2, ...],
  stateMachines: [machine],
  ...
});

await rollup.init() // [!code focus]
```

## Let's Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ [Sandbox mode]

To be doubly sure that everything is working fine, let's try to run your application and see if it works as expected.

In this example, we will run our micro-rollup in sandbox mode.

:::info
**Sandbox mode** üß™

Sandbox mode doesn't require registration or deployment of your MRU. The SDK creates a temporary SQLite database to store data and the blocks are not sent to Vulcan or L1 for verification.
It's recommended to use this mode while development and for experimentation. Enable this by setting `isSandbox` property to `true` in `stackr.config.ts`.
:::

### Run using Node.js 

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm start
```
```bash [bun]
# Note that `bun` is just used to run script in package.json here, start command still points to `tsx`
bun start
```

:::

### Run using Docker üê≥

- Build the image using the following command:

:::code-group

```bash [Linux]
docker build -t <app_name>:latest .
```
```bash [Mac w/ Apple Silicon]
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t <app_name>:latest .
```
:::

- Run the Docker container using the following command:

:::code-group
```bash [File-based DB]
docker run --env-file .env \
  -v ./db.sqlite:/app/db.sqlite \
  -p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT> \
  --name=<app_name> -it <app_name>:latest
```
```bash [URI-based DB]
docker run --env-file .env \
  -p <HOST_PORT>:<CONTAINER_PORT> \
  --name=<app_name> -it <app_name>:latest
```
:::

If everything is working fine, you should see the logs in the terminal, like this:

```bash [Terminal]
[Stackr] - 04/02/2024, 5:14:19 PM     LOG [InstanceLoader] ExecutorModule dependencies initialized
[Stackr] - 04/02/2024, 5:14:19 PM     LOG [InstanceLoader] SequencerModule dependencies initialized
[Stackr] - 04/02/2024, 5:14:19 PM     LOG [L1-Syncer] Started L1 syncer
[Stackr] - 04/02/2024, 5:14:19 PM     LOG [Vulcan-Syncer] Started with slot time: 1000ms
[Stackr] - 04/02/2024, 5:14:19 PM     LOG [Sequencer] Started with block time: 1000ms
```

If you see the above logs, congratulations! Your application is running successfully.

## Interacting with Micro-rollup

If you are using the "Counter" example, the `index.ts` file already contains the code to interact with the micro-rollup.

### Submitting Action

Using the [`submitAction`](/build/framework/micro-rollup-utils#submitactionreducername-string-action-action) method, you can submit the action to the micro-rollup.

```ts [index.ts]
const inputs = {
  timestamp: Date.now(),
};

const signature = await signMessage(wallet, UpdateCounterSchema, inputs);
// [!code word:actionFrom]
const incrementAction = UpdateCounterSchema.actionFrom({
  // [!code word:inputs]
  inputs,
  signature,
  msgSender: wallet.address,
});

const ack = await mru.submitAction("increment", incrementAction); // [!code hl]
```

:::info
The code above is just for reference, mostly you won't be signing the message here on your backend. Rather you'll get the action parameters (`inputs`, `signature` and `msgSender`) together from the frontend and then submit the action to the micro-rollup.
:::


Once an action is submitted to the micro-rollup, you get an acknowledgment in the form of a `Promise` which resolves to the `Acknowledgment` object. You can use this object to track the status of the action.

### Tracking Action's Lifecycle

#### Using `ack.waitFor`

The `Acknowledgment` object returned by `submitAction` contains a [`waitFor`](/build/framework/micro-rollup-utils#ackwaitforconfirmationstatus--actionconfirmationstatusc1) method that can be used to wait for the action to reach a specific confirmation status.

```ts [index.ts]
import { SerializedAction } from "@stackr/sdk";

/* ... */

// resolves when action reaches C1
// [!code word:waitFor]
const action: SerializedAction = await ack.waitFor(ActionConfirmationStatus.C1); // [!code hl]
```

:::tip
üöÄ **Build real-time apps** üöÄ

Since micro-rollups [execute actions within millseconds](/build/framework/action/confirmation-status#c1--executed-milliseconds), you immediately get feedback on the effects of the action. This allows, for example, a familiar Web2-style request-response flow where the action's changes to state or logs can be returned in response to the very same request that submitted the action. This is really useful for real-time apps that require an instant and interactive responsive UI.
:::

#### Using events

You can also use the `subscribe` method to listen for changes to the action's lifecycle. 

For example, you can define a custom callback function subscribing to the [`ActionEvents.CONFIRMATION_STATUS`](/build/framework/events/#actioneventsconfirmation_status) event that is called whenever the confirmation status of the action changes, like this:

```ts [index.ts]
import { ActionEvents } from "@stackr/sdk";

/* ... */

mru.events.subscribe(ActionEvents.CONFIRMATION_STATUS, ({ actionName, actionHash, status }) => {
  console.log({ actionName, actionHash, status });
});
```

Refer to the [Events](/build/framework/events) section for more details on this.

### Querying the State

You can also query the state of your State Machines anytime using the MRU instance. As below:

```ts [index.ts]
const machine = mru.stateMachines.get<typeof counterMachine>("counter"); // [!code focus]
if (!machine) {
  throw new Error("Machine not found");
}
const { state } = machine; // [!code focus]
console.log("Current state:", state);
```

### Play with it

Stackr comes with a [Playground](/build/plugins/playground) plugin along with the SDK to interact with the micro-rollup. You can attach the plugin to your MRU instance and use it to debug, interact or track the life-cycle of action or block.

```ts [mru.ts]
import { Playground } from "@stackr/sdk/plugins"; // [!code focus]

const mru = new MicroRollup({
    ...
});

Playground.init(mru); // [!code focus]
```

This will spin up a local server on `http://localhost:42069` by default, which will be utilized by our Playground app to interact with your MRU.

You can now visit [playground.stf.xyz](https://playground.stf.xyz) in your browser to interact with your micro-rollup. If prompted give it the URL of your local server started by playground.

### Everything else...

You can refer to [Micro-Rollup Utilities](/build/framework/micro-rollup-utils) section for details on all the methods available to interact with the `MicroRollup` instance.

## Next Steps

In this section, we learned how to run our micro-rollup and interact with it.

:::info
You can find the full breakdown of this app in the [Counter Rollup Tutorial](/build/guides/tutorials/counter) guide.
:::

You can now start building and customizing your rollup using the Stackr SDK. Start by modifying the `machine.ts`, `transitions.ts`, and relevant files as per your requirements.

You can wrap the micro-rollup in a REST API or GraphQL API to interact with it from the frontend.

In the next section, we will learn how to register and deploy our application on Stackr's network and on-chain.
