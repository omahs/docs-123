# Registering and deploying a Micro-rollup

Once you are done with the setup, development and sandbox testing of your micro-rollup, it is time to register and deploy your application on Stackr's network and on-chain.

## Registering your Micro-rollup

Refer to [`register`](/build/cli/register) command in CLI section.

## Deploying your Micro-rollup

Refer to [`deploy`](/build/cli/deploy) command in CLI section.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned how to create a micro-rollup using the Stackr SDK, register and deploy it to the Vulcan network and on-chain, and interact with it using the SDK.

You may proceed to the [Framework](/build/framework/config) section to better understand the Stackr SDK, and to the [Guides](/build/guides/community-examples) and [Plugins](/build/plugins/playground) sections for more advanced use-cases.
