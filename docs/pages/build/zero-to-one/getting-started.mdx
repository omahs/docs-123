# Getting Started [Prepare your development environment]

The first step to start developing Micro-Rollups with Stackr is to prepare your development environment and making sure that all the system requirements are upto date and matches the required versions.

## Prerequisites

### Git

Incase you don't already have it, you can follow the instructions at [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### NodeJS LTS or above

:::code-group

```bash [Linux / MacOS]
# Install Node Version Manager (nvm)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

# Install NodeJS and npm (LTS versions)
nvm install --lts
```

```bash [Windows]
# Install Chocolatey
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;

```

### Stackr CLI

The Stackr CLI helps you to create, register and deploy your micro-rollups.

:::warning

##### Remove previously installed Stackr CLI

If you have previously installed the Stackr CLI binary from 2023, you need to uninstall it first.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.stackr
```

:::

Either you can install it globally using

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i -g @stackr/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun i -g @stackr/cli
```

:::

OR

you can run the commands without installing

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx @stackr/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bunx @stackr/cli
```
