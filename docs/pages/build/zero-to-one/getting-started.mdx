# Getting Started [Prepare your development environment]

The first step to start developing Micro-Rollups with Stackr is to prepare your development environment and making sure that all the system requirements are upto date and matches the required versions.

## Prerequisites

### Git

Incase you don't already have it, you can follow the instructions at [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Bun

The Bun runtime to required to run the micro-rollups and optionally for package management.

:::info
Right now, we only support the Bun runtime due to some of its unique capabilities. However, Bun is not stable and often runs into memory leaks. We are actively working on supporting Node.js runtime.
:::

```bash [Linux / MacOS]
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

More information regarding Bun can be found at https://bun.sh/docs/installation.

### NodeJS LTS or above

Node.js is only required for npm, if you wish to use it for package management.

:::code-group

```bash [Linux / MacOS]
# Install Node Version Manager (nvm)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

# Install NodeJS and npm (LTS versions)
nvm install --lts
```

```bash [Windows]
# Install Chocolatey
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072;
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'));

# Install NodeJS
choco install nodejs --version="lts"
```

:::

### Stackr CLI

The Stackr CLI helps you to create, register and deploy your micro-rollups.

:::warning

##### Remove previously installed Stackr CLI

If you have previously installed the Stackr CLI binary from 2023, you need to uninstall it first.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.stackr
```

:::

Either you can install it globally using

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i -g @stackr/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bun i -g @stackr/cli
```

:::

OR

you can run the commands without installing

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx @stackr/cli
```

```bash [bun]
bunx @stackr/cli
```

:::

## Next Steps

Now that we are done with the prerequisites, proceed to the next section on how to create and setup your first Micro-Rollup.
