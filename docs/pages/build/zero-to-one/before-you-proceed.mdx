# Before you proceed

Understand that this is a highly experimental framework and not recommended for production use. There are some gotchas to keep in mind:

1. The SDK and CLI are still under development and may have regular breaking changes.
2. **The L1 and DA settlement cost as well as verification fees is currently sponsored by Stackr and may change in the future.**
3. The framework is yet audited and may have security vulnerabilities.

Please help us by providing feedback and reporting any issues you encounter. We are committed to making the framework better and more secure. ðŸ«¡
