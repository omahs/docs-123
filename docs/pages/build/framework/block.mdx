# Block [Heart of the blockchain]

Blocks are the basic entity of a blockchain. It encodes a set of actions that are executed in a single atomic operation. It also includes the commitment to the state of the application that was changed by the actions included in that block.

## Blocks on Stackr

A block in Stackr framework looks like this

```ts [block.ts]
interface BlockData {
  appId: number;
  parentHash: string;
  height: number;
  hash: string;
  timestamp: number;
  actionRoot: string;
  acknowledgementRoot: string;
  stateRoot: string;
  operatorSignature: SignatureLike;
  builderSignature: SignatureLike;
  executionStatus: number;
  actions: {
    action: {
      hash: string;
      name: string;
      payload: AllowedInputTypes;
      msgSender: AddressLike;
      signature: SignatureLike;
    };
    acknowledgement: {
      hash: string;
      height: number;
      timestamp: number;
      operatorSignature: SignatureLike;
    };
  }[];
  batchInfo?: BatchInfo;
}
```

### Header

- `appId`: The application id to which this block belongs to.
- `parentHash`: The hash of the parent block.
- `height`: The height of the block in the chain.
- `hash`: The hash of the block.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp at which the block was created.
- `actionRoot`: The root hash of the actions included in the block.
- `acknowledgementRoot`: The root hash of the acknowledgements of the actions included in the block.
- `stateRoot`: The root hash of the state after applying the actions in the block.
- `operatorSignature`: The signature of the operator on the block.
- `builderSignature`: The signature of the builder on the block.
- `executionStatus`: The status of the block execution. It is an encoded value that represents which action succeeded and which failed.
- `batchInfo` : The information about the batch to which the block belongs.

### Body

- `actions`: The list of actions included in the block along with their acknowledgements.
