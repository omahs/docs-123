# Type Definitions [Reference of useful types exposed by the SDK]

## `ActionParams`

The minimum required fields to construct an Action. Consists of `name` of the transition, the `inputs` to pass to the transition, `signature` of the user on the STF name and inputs, and the `msgSender` being the user's address.

```ts
interface ActionParams {
  name: string;
  inputs: AllowedInputTypes;
  signature: string;
  msgSender: string;
}
```

## `SerializedAction`

```ts
interface SerializedAction {
  name: string;
  signature: string;
  msgSender: string;
  payload: AllowedInputTypes;
  executionStatus: ActionExecutionStatus | null;
  confirmationStatus: ActionConfirmationStatus | null;
  isReverted: boolean;
  hash: string;
  logs: ExecutionLog[] | null;
  errors: ExecutionError[] | null;
}
```

- `name`: The name of the action sent.
- `signature`: The signature of the action. This is used to authenticate the user who signed the action.
- `msgSender`: The address of the user who sent the action.
- `payload`: The data of the action. This is the actual data that the action is supposed to mutate the state with.
- `executionStatus`: The status of the execution of the action (Defaults to `CREATED`). More on this [here](/build/framework/action/execution-status).
- `confirmationStatus`: The confirmation status for the action (Defaults to `CX`). More on this [here](/build/framework/action/confirmation-status).
- `isReverted`: A boolean flag to indicate if the action is reverted or not at the execution level.
- `hash`: The keccak256 hash of the action.
- `logs`: Returns the execution logs for the action. If not null, the execution succeeded without any errors. It is null if the action has not yet been executed.
- `errors`: Returns any errors that occurred during the execution of the action. It is null if the action has not yet been executed.

## `SerializedBlock`

```ts
interface SerializedBlock {
  height: number;
  hash: string;
  timestamp: number;
  status: BlockStatus;
  batchInfo?: BatchInfo;
}
```

These fields are described in the [Block](/build/framework/block) section.

## `SerializedActionAndBlock`

When using the [`MicroRollupResponse.actions.query`](/build/framework/micro-rollup-utils/#actionsqueryfilters-actionfilterparams-orderasc-boolean) method, the `SerializedAction` also includes block details. Then its datatype is `SerializedActionAndBlock` and looks like

```ts
interface SerializedActionAndBlock extends SerializedAction {
  block: SerializedBlock | null;
}
```

## `SerializedAcknowledgment`

```ts
type WaitableConfirmationStatus =
  | ActionConfirmationStatus.C1
  | ActionConfirmationStatus.C2
  | ActionConfirmationStatus.C3A
  | ActionConfirmationStatus.C3B;

interface SerializedAcknowledgement {
  hash: Keccak256;
  actionHash: Keccak256;
  currentHeight: number;
  timestamp: number;
  operatorSignature: SignatureLike;
  operator: AddressLike;
  waitFor(
    confirmationStatus?: WaitableConfirmationStatus,
  ): Promise<SerializedAction>;
}
```

## `AcknowledgedAction`

```ts
interface AcknowledgedAction {
  action: {
    hash: Keccak256;
    name: string;
    payload: AllowedInputTypes;
    msgSender: AddressLike;
    signature: SignatureLike;
    executionStatus: ActionExecutionStatus | null;
    confirmationStatus: ActionConfirmationStatus | null;
  };
  acknowledgement: {
    hash: Keccak256;
    height: number;
    timestamp: number;
    operatorSignature: SignatureLike;
  };
}
```

## `ChainData`

```ts
interface ChainData {
  appId: number;
  parentHash: string;
  height: number;
}
```
