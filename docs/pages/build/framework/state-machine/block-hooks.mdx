# Block Hooks

Blocks hooks are functions (Similar to [State transition functions](/build/framework/state-machine/state-transitions)) that are automatically executed before or after the execution of all the actions on the block as per configuration. Hooks are executed once per block and a representation of the same is stored in Block Headers for verification later

## Hooks in Stackr

Our SDK provides a way to create execution hooks for the blocks.

A basic hook in Stackr looks like this:

```typescript
import { Hook, Hooks } from "@stackr/sdk/machine";
import { CounterState } from "./machine";

const addTwo: Hook<CounterState> = {
  handler: ({ state }) => {
    state += 2;
    return state;
  },
};

const minusTwo: Hook<CounterState> = {
  handler: ({ state }) => {
    state -= 2;
    return state;
  },
};

export const hooks: Hooks<CounterState> = {
  addTwo,
  minusTwo,
};
```

In the above example, we have two hooks `addTwo` and `minusTwo`. These hooks have a handler, and they take in current state, applies the hook logic & return the new state.

## Hooks in Detail

The most important part of the Hooks is the `handler` function. This function only has access to the current state & the blockInfo `height`, `timestamp` & `parentHash`. Like State Transition Functions, they should be pure functions too & should return the new state after the applying the logic.

:::warning
There is no execution status for the hooks. If a hook execution fails, then the block execution fails too.

## Defining the Hooks for MicroRollup

To configure these hooks, `hooks` has to be passed in [StateMachine](/build/framework/state-machine/introduction#state-machines-in-stackr) & then `pre` & `post` hooks can be defined as follows on the MircoRollup :

```ts [mru.ts]
const mru = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [UpdateCounterSchema],
  stateMachines: [machine],
  blockHooks: // [!code hl] {
    pre: ["addTwo"], // [!code hl]
    post: ["minusTwo"], // [!code hl]
  },// [!code hl]
});
```

In this case, we call `addTwo` before and `minusTwo` after the block is executed. Mutliple hooks can be added for both of the triggers by just passing the hook name as string in the array.

:::info
When dealing with multiple hooks, ensure that the names of the hooks in the array are passed in the order corresponding to their intended execution.
