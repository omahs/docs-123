# Action [Basic interaction unit in an MRU]

Actions are the fundamental unit of interaction. They are the building block of a state machine that captures the user's input. These are analogous to transactions in a regular blockchain system with the difference that these are just signed messages that the users send to the micro-rollup.

Actions are used to trigger a state mutation in the MRU which is handled by the state transition function.

## Actions vs transactions

Actions are similar to transactions in a blockchain system. The key difference is that actions are not broadcasted to any network. They are just signed messages that the users send to the micro-rollup.

## Action Cost

Stackr does not enforce a cost for an action in this version. 
However, Micro-Rollup developers are free to design their actions to include a cost component to charge users.

## Action Format

In a gist, an action has the following properties to be able to mutate a state machine:
```typescript
export interface IAction {
  identifier: string;
  msgSender: AddressLike;
  signature: SignatureLike;
  payload: AllowedInputTypes;
}
```
- `identifier`: A unique identifier for the action. This allows the state machine to redirect it to the correct state transition function.
- `msgSender`: The address of the user who sent the action.
- `signature`: The signature of the action. This is used to authenticate the user who signed the action.
- `payload`: The data of the action. This is the actual data that the action is supposed to mutate the state with.

## Action Creation

Actions are constructed via `ActionSchema`s. More on this [here](/build/framework/action/action-schema).

Once you've generated the schema for your action, you can use the `actionFrom` function on your schema to create a new action.
The schema ensures that your action is well-formed and adheres to the schema's rules while also being EIP 712 'signable'.
Here's an example of how you can create an action from a schema:

```typescript
const action = NewSchema.actionFrom({
  inputs,
  signature,
  msgSender: wallet.address,
});
```
- The `inputs` are of whatever type you defined in your schema.
- The `signature` is an EIP712 signature over the action's `inputs`. This is used to authenticate the user who signed the action. 
It can be created using your action schema like this:
```typescript
const signature = await wallet.signTypedData(
    schema.domain,
    schema.EIP712TypedData.types,
    payload,
  );
```
- The `msgSender` is the address of the user who sent the action.

Your action is now ready for submission!

## Action Submission
Your action can now be submitted to the Micro-Rollup's State Machine.
All this requires calling the `submitAction` function on your Micro-Rollup.
```typescript
let ack = await rollup.submitAction("<REDUCER-NAME>", action);
```
We also pass in the name of the reducer that will be handling your action. 
These are state transition functions that you will be defining in the `src/stackr/transitions.ts` file.
On succesful submission, you will recieve an `Acknowledment` object that acts like a transaction receipt and is also considered a `C0` confirmation.
This is proof of the action being successfully submitted to the state machine.

## Action Execution

## EIP-712 Signing
EIP 712 is a standard for signing structured data. It is used to sign actions in this version of Stackr.
This also makes Stackr Actions compatible with existing browser wallet extensions and other EVM-friendly wallet implementations.
