# Action [Basic interaction unit in an MRU]

Actions are the fundamental unit of interaction. They are the building block of a state machine that captures the user's input. These are analogous to transactions in a regular blockchain system with the difference that these are just signed messages that the users send to the micro-rollup.

Actions are used to trigger a state mutation in the MRU which is handled by the state transition function.

## Actions vs transactions

Actions are similar to transactions in a blockchain system. The key difference is that actions are not broadcasted to any network. They are just signed messages that the users send to the micro-rollup.

## Action Cost

Stackr does not enforce a cost for an action in this version.
However, Micro-Rollup developers are free to design their actions to include a cost component to charge users.

## Action Format

In a gist, an action has the following properties to be able to mutate a state machine:

```typescript
interface IAction {
  name: string;
  msgSender: string;
  signature: string;
  inputs: AllowedInputTypes;
}
```

- `name`: Name of the state transition function.
- `msgSender`: The address of the user who sent the action.
- `signature`: The signature of the action. This is used to authenticate the user who signed the action.
- `inputs`: The user-provided payload of the action. This is the actual data that the action is supposed to mutate the state with.

## Action Creation & Submission

This is covered as part of the [Counter Rollup Tutorial](/build/guides/tutorials/counter#interacting-with-the-rollup).

:::note
An action's payload size should not exceed ~128kb. This limit is enforced to keep batch size well within the means of different DA layer's maximum supported blob size.

## EIP-712 Signing

[EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) is a standard for signing structured data. It is used to sign actions in this version of Stackr.
This also makes Stackr Actions compatible with existing browser wallet extensions and other EVM-friendly wallet implementations.

## Action Execution

Once the action is submitted, it goes in the rollup's action pool, similar to a traditional mempool. The action stays in the pool until picked up by a sequencer.

The sequencer picks up the action, creates a block and sends that block to the executor. The executor then executes the block and updates the state of the rollup.
