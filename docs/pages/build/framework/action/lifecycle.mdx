# Action Lifecycle

## Features

Any action submitted to the Micro-Rollup goes through a series of stages in its lifecycle. The action lifecycle is broadly classified into 2 groups

### Execution Lifecycle

The execution lifecycle of an action directly relates to the updation of state within the Micro-Rollup.

It consists of the following stages:

1. User creates an action
2. User submits the action
3. Action is acknowledged
4. Action is included in a block
5. Action is executed

The execution of the action can be successful or can be reverted based on the state transition function.

### Confirmation Lifecycle

The confirmation lifecycle of an action relates to the finality of the action. It means if the action has been successfully received, executed, verified and stored on-chain.

It consists of the following stages:

1. Action is acknowledged
2. Action is executed
3. Action is verified
4. Action is finalized

Action finalization are split into 2 parts

- finalized and published on DA
- finalized and stored on Ethereum

## Acccessing the Action Lifecycle

The action's lifecycle update can be accessed through micro-rollup's `events` framework. More about this can be found in the [Events](/build/framework/events) section.
