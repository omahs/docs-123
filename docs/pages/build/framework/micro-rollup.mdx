# Micro-Rollup [The star of the show]

The micro-rollup utility is the hero of the Stackr framework

A micro-rollup is initialized this -

```ts [index.ts]
import { MicroRollup } from "@stackr/sdk";
/* ... other imports ... */

const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  stateMachines: [machine],
});

await rollup.init();
```

The Micro-rollup object takes in 2 main parameters -

1. `config` - The stackr configuration object

all the details that you set in the [`stackr.config.ts`](/build/framework/config) file is passed to the micro-rollup like this. It uses this configuration to set up the environment for the rollup and instantiate the Sequencer, Executor and Syncer.

2. `stateMachines` - The state machine

The state machine is the heart of the rollup. It defines the state transition rules and the actions that can be performed in each state.

:::info
Currently the Micro-Rollup supports only 1 state machine. This may be extended in the future.

## Optional parameters

The Micro-Rollup object also takes in 1 optional parameter -

1. `blockHooks` - An object containing two keys `pre` and `post` both being ordered array of names of the `hooks` to execute with each block.
