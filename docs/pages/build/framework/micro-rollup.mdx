# Micro-Rollup [The star of the show]

The micro-rollup utility is the hero of the Stackr framework

A micro-rollup is initialized this -

```ts [index.ts]
import { MicroRollup } from "@stackr/sdk";

const rollup = await MicroRollup({
  config: stackrConfig,
  actionSchemas: [...actionSchemas],
  stateMachines: [machine],
});

await rollup.init();
```

The Micro-rollup object takes in 3 main parameters -

1. `config` - The stackr configuration object

all the details that you set in the `stackr.config.ts` file is passed to the micro-rollup like this. It uses this configuration to set up the environment for the rollup and instantiate the Sequencer, Executor and Syncer.

2. `actionSchemas` - The action schemas defined earlier

The action schemas are the blueprints for the actions that the rollup can perform. These are defined previously and are passed to the micro-rollup to be used in the execution of the actions. The rollup takes in an action and matches it with state transition rules to execute the action.

3. `stateMachines` - The state machine

The state machine is the heart of the rollup. It defines the state transition rules and the actions that can be performed in each state.

:::info
Currently the Micro-Rollup supports only 1 state machine. This will be extended in the future.

## Optional parameters

The Micro-Rollup object also takes in a few optional parameters

1. `isSandbox` - A boolean flag to indicate if the rollup is running in a sandbox environment,

when running in a sandbox mode, the rollup creates a temporary database to store the state and the actions and the blocks are not sent to Vulcan for verification.
This is useful for testing and debugging purposes

2. `disableVulcanSync` - A boolean flag to indicate if the rollup should not sync with Vulcan. This happens by default in sandbox mode.

3. `disableBuilder` - A boolean flag to indicate if the rollup should not use the builder to generate the blocks. This is useful for functionally generating blocks when needed. More about it in the next section.

4. `disableL1Sync` - A boolean flag to indicate if the rollup should not sync with the L1 chain.

5. `stfSchemaMap` - A map of the schema names to the schema objects. This is used to map the schema names to the state transitions of the rollup.

6. `blockHooks` -  Pre and Post block hooks to be added to the state machine.
