# Stackr Config [Parameters of the Micro-Rollup]

The `stackr.config.ts` file is the main configuration file for the micro-rollup. It contains all the parameters that are used to configure the micro-rollup.

```ts [stackr.config.ts]
const stackrConfig: StackrConfig = {
  stackrApp: {
    appId: deployment.appId,
    appInbox: deployment.appInbox,
  },
  sequencer: {
    blockSize: 16,
    blockTime: 10,
    enableEmptyBlocks: true,
  },
  syncer: {
    slotTime: 1000,
    vulcanRPC: process.env.VULCAN_RPC as string,
    L1RPC: process.env.L1_RPC as string,
  },
  operator: {
    accounts: [
      {
        privateKey: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string,
        purpose: KeyPurpose.BATCH,
        scheme: SignatureScheme.ECDSA,
      },
    ],
  },
  domain: {
    name: "Stackr MVP v0",
    version: "1",
    chainId: deployment.chainId,
    verifyingContract: deployment.appInbox,
    salt: "0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  },
  datastore: {
    uri: "./db.sqlite",
  },
  registryContract: REGISTRY_CONTRACT,
  preferredDA: DA.AVAIL,
  logLevel: "error",
};
```

## Parameters

1. `stackrApp`: Contains the `appId` and `appInbox` of the micro-rollup.

This is set during registration of the micro-rollup with the registry contract using `stackr register` command. See [Register](/build/cli/register) for more details.

---

2. `sequencer`: Contains the parameters for the sequencer module.

- `blockSize`: The number of actions that the sequencer picks up in a single block.
- `blockTime`: The time interval after which the sequencer picks up the actions in a block.
- `enableEmptyBlocks`: A boolean flag to allow creation of empty blocks with no actions.

---

3. `syncer`: Contains the parameters for the syncer module.

- `slotTime`: The time interval after which the rollup sends a block to Vulcan for verification and finalization
- `vulcanRPC`: The RPC endpoint of the Vulcan chain.
- `L1RPC`: The RPC endpoint of the L1 chain.

---

4. `operator`: Contains the parameters for the operator module.

- `accounts`: Contains the private key of the operator account. This private key is used for registration and batch signing

---

5. `domain`: Contains the parameters for the EIP-712 domain.

- `name`: The name of the micro-rollup
- `version`: The version of the micro-rollup
- `chainId`: The chainId of the parent chain, in this case its sepolia (11155111)
- `verifyingContract`: The address of the appInbox
- `salt`: A random salt value

---

6. `datastore`: Contains the parameters for the datastore module.

This is used for local storage of the micro-rollup state, actions and blocks

---

7. `registryContract`: The address of the registry contract

---

8. `preferredDA`: The preferred data availability layer

We currently support two data availability layers -

1. Avail
2. Celestia

with more support of data availability layers coming soon. No additional configuration is required beyond selecting the preferred data availability layer.

---

9. `logLevel`: The log level of the micro-rollup

This is used for viewing the logs of the micro-rollup during runtime. Logs are a useful tool for debugging and monitoring the micro-rollup and checking for any errors.
