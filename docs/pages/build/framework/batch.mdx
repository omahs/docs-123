# Batch

Batches are structured collections of blocks within a blockchain. It includes multiple blocks covering specific height ranges along with transaction hash and DA data. Confirmation statuses from ``C3A`` and beyond are fetched from batches.
Also, batches gets settled on L1 every 6 hours.

As a developer/operator/end-user, you don't need to worry about batches.

## Batches on Stackr

A batch in Stackr framework looks like this :

```ts [batch.ts]
interface BatchInfo {
  hash: string;
  sequenceNumber: number;
  firstBlockHeight: number;
  lastBlockHeight: number;
  daMetadata: Record<DA, Record<string, never>>;
  l1TransactionHash: string;
  l1BlockNumber?: number;
}
```

- `hash` : The hash of the batch. It is the merklised hash of the block hashes of the blocks included in the batch.
- `sequenceNumber` :  The sequential order in which batches are created, starting from 1.
- `firstBlockHeight` : The block height of the first block included in the batch.
- `lastBlockHeight` : The block height of the last block included in the batch.
- `daMetadata` : The data fetched from the DA in the Vulcan response for the batch.
- `l1TransactionHash` : The transaction hash for the finalisation of the batch on L1.
- `l1BlockNumber` : The transaction number for the finalisation of the block on L1.
