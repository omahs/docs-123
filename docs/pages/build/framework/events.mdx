# Events Framework [Get granular insights into the Micro-Rollup]

Stackr provides a really powerful events framework that allows developers to get granular insights into the Micro-Rollup's working. This framework is designed to provide a detailed view of the state transitions that are happening within the Micro-Rollup.

## Subscribing to events

You can subscribe to specific events by using the `events` utility returned by the rollup instance

## Event Types and Arguments
