# Hosting [How to host your Micro-Rollup]

Your Micro-rollup comes with a pre-configured Dockerfile. This can be used to host it on many popular cloud platforms.

- [Fly.io](#using-flyio)
- [Railway](#using-railway)
- [EC2](#using-ec2)

## Using Fly.io

Fly.io is a cloud platform that allows developers to deploy and run applications globally. It offers a simple and efficient way to host web applications, including Micro-Rollups.

### Prerequisites

- [Fly.io CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

### Steps

1. `cd` into your Micro-Rollup repository
2. Login to `fly.io`
```bash [Terminal]
fly auth signup
fly auth login # if you are already logged in
```

3. Copy this `fly.toml` file into your root directory.
```toml [fly.toml]
app = '<name>'
primary_region = 'atl'

[build]

[[mounts]]
  source = 'my_rollup'
  destination = '/data'

[http_service]
  internal_port = 3210
  force_https = true
  auto_stop_machines = 'off'
  auto_start_machines = true
  min_machines_running = 1
  processes = ['app']

[[vm]]
  memory = '1gb'
  cpu_kind = 'shared'
  cpus = 1
```
Make sure to replace `<name>` with your app name, and feel free to change the other settings as you see fit.

2. Launch your app without deploying it.
```bash
fly launch --no-deploy
```

Answer 'yes' to copy config for a new app.

```bash
? Would you like to copy its configuration to the new app? Y
```
3. Create a fly volume to persist your rollup's state.
```bash
fly volume create my_rollup -r atl -n 1
```
4. Change your `.env` file to point `DATABASE_URI` to the fly volume's mount point.
```bash [.env]
DATABASE_URI="/data/db.sqlite"
```
5. Import your `.env` file into `fly.io`.
```bash
cat .env | fly secrets import
```
6. Now, deploy your rollup!
```bash
fly deploy
```


## Using Railway

Railway is a modern cloud platform that offers an easy and efficient way to deploy, manage, and scale applications. It provides a seamless experience for hosting various types of projects, including Micro-Rollups.

### Prerequisites

- Repo hosted on GitHub

### Steps

1. `cd` into your Micro-Rollup repository
2. Change your `stackr.config.ts` to use `postgres` as the database. Railway supports Postgres and MySQL.
3. Install PostgreSQL client
```bash [Terminal]
npm install pg --save
```
4. Copy this `railway.json` file into your root directory.
```json [railway.json]
{
    "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
    "build": {
        "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
        "dockerfilePath": "./Dockerfile"
    },
    "deploy": {
        "runtime": "V2",
        "numReplicas": 1,
        "sleepApplication": false,
        "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
        "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
    }
}
```
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
4. Log into your Railway account and link your GitHub repository by following this [guide](https://docs.railway.app/quick-start#deploying-your-project---from-github).
Do not deploy your project yet. Instead choose the option to `Add variables`.
5. When your project canvas opens, on the right, start adding variables from your `.env` file. (Copy-pasting with the raw editor is faster)
6. For the `DATABASE_URI` variable, use the value:
```bash
DATABASE_URI=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
```
6. Now, click on the `Create` button on the top right and create a new Postgres database service.
7. Once the DB service is created, your micro-rollup should be visually connected to the DB service.
8. Deploy your project with all the new changes.


## Using EC2

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of AWS services
- SSH client (for connecting to your EC2 instance)

### Steps

1. Follow this [guide](https://hostadvice.com/how-to/web-hosting/containers/how-to-use-docker-containers-with-aws-ec2/) to spin up an EC2 instance with Docker enabled.
2. Build and run your rollup's docker container by following the instructions [here](/build/zero-to-one/run-it).

## Hosting tips
- Check your `.env` to make sure your variables are set properly and pointing to our [Sepolia network](/build/references/providers-and-rpc).
- Check your `stackr.config.ts` to make sure you are not deploying in Sandbox mode.
- Next step could be to create a custom domain and point it to your hosted instance.

Feel free to contact the Stackr team if you have any questions.
Happy rolling! ðŸ›¼
