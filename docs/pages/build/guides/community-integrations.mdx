# Community Integrations [What others are building]

## Official Examples Repository

You can find the official examples repository at [Micro-Rollup examples](https://github.com/stackrlabs/micro-rollup-examples). We also include these as starter templates when initializing a new project using the Stackr CLI.

## Community Examples

### [Integration of Oracles](https://github.com/Dhruv-2003/Oracles-mru-integration?tab=readme-ov-file)

This allows you to feed external price data into the rollup, enabling state transitions based on live data from Chainlink, Chronicle, or Pyth.

### [Integration of Wallet providers](https://github.com/Dhruv-2003/Walletprovider-mru-example?tab=readme-ov-file)

This will enable users to interact with the rollup using their preferred wallet provider such as social login, metamask, coinbase & much more
