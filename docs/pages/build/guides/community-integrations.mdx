# Community Integrations [What others are building]

## Official Examples Repository

You can find the official examples repository at [Micro-Rollup examples](https://github.com/stackrlabs/micro-rollup-examples). We also include these as starter templates when initializing a new project using the Stackr CLI.

## Community Examples

### [Integration of Oracles](https://github.com/Dhruv-2003/Oracles-mru-integration?tab=readme-ov-file)

This allows you to feed external price data into the rollup, enabling state transitions based on live data from Chainlink, Chronicle, or Pyth.

### [Integration of Wallet providers](https://github.com/Dhruv-2003/Walletprovider-mru-example?tab=readme-ov-file)

This will enable users to interact with the rollup using their preferred wallet provider such as social login, metamask, coinbase & much more

### [Integration of Cross Chain Bridging](https://github.com/Architsharma7/Bridges-Stackr)

This will help you set up a cross-chain bridge for message passing/token bridging from any other chain to Stackr’s Micro-rollups using **Hyperlane**, **Axelar** or **LayerZero**.

### [Integration of Event Notifier via Wallet Messaging](https://github.com/Architsharma7/XMTP-MRU)

This will help you build an Event Notifier for the user for Stackr’s Micro-rollup using **XMTP**.

### [Integration of Access Control](https://github.com/Architsharma7/Lit-Stackr)

This will help you apply access control based on the Micro-rollup’s state using **Lit Actions** and session signatures.
