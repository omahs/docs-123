# `compile` [Compile your app's state machine to Wasm]

The `compile` command is used to compile your Micro-Rollup's State Machine to portable WebAssembly (Wasm) binary.

:::info
Generally, you wouldn't use this command manually since the [`deploy`]((/build/cli/deploy)) command takes care of this step internally.
:::

## Usage

```bash
» stackr compile --help
USAGE
  $ stackr compile

EXAMPLES
  $ stackr compile
```

## Example

Make sure you are in the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
$ npx @stackr/cli@latest compile
```

If all goes well, you will see the following output:

```bash
✔ 🏗️  State Machine built
```

The produced build artifacts and the Wasm binary are placed inside the `stackr_build` directory.

```bash
$ ls stackr_build
build_logs.txt stf.js         stf.ts         stf.wasm
```

You may refer to the [Checking your Wasm Binary](/build/guides/checking-your-binaries) section on how to check whether the binary was correctly compiled.
