# `deploy` [Send the app to Vulcan]

The `deploy` command is used to deploy your Micro-Rollup to the Vulcan network as well as set the initial genesis conditions on-chain.

It performs the following 3 operations:

1. Extracts and compiles the State Machine into Wasm ([`compile`](/build/cli/compile) command)
2. Creates a commitment of the Wasm (binary) and genesis state (JSON), signs it using the operator private key and sends it to the `AppInbox` contract to initialize the application
3. Uploads the Wasm binary to Vulcan.

:::warning
After deployment, if you make any changes to the genesis state or state machine code, you'd need to re-register and re-deploy your application.

## Usage

```bash
» stackr deploy --help
USAGE
  $ stackr deploy [--envFile <value>] [--privateKey <value>]

FLAGS
  --envFile=<value>     [default: .env] Path to the .env file
  --privateKey=<value>  Private key of the account to be used to deploy the contract

EXAMPLES
  $ stackr deploy

  $ stackr deploy --privateKey <privateKey>
```

## Example

```bash
npx @stackr/cli@latest deploy
```

If all goes well, you will see the following output:

```bash
✔ 🏗️ State Machine built
✔ 📝 Registered STF to AppInbox
✔ 🖖 Deployed to Vulcan
```

Now the application is ready to be run and send blocks to the Vulcan network for verification.
