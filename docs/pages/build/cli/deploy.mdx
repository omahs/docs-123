# `deploy` [Send the app to Vulcan]

The `deploy` command is used to deploy your Micro-Rollup to the Vulcan network as well as set the initial genesis conditions on-chain.

It does 3 things

1. Extracts and compiles the State Machine into WASM
2. Creates a commitment to the State Machine and genesis state, signs it using the operator private key and sends it to the `AppInbox` contract to initialize the application
3. Uploads the WASM binary to Vulcan

## Usage

```bash
npx @stackr/sdk@latest deploy
```

## Output

If all goes well, you will see the following output

```bash
✔ 🏗️ State Machine built
✔ 📝 Registered STF to AppInbox
✔ 🖖 Deployed to Vulcan
```

Now the application is ready to be run and send blocks to the Vulcan network for verification.
