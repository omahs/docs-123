# `add-bridge` [Deploy a bridge and register with AppInbox]

The `add-bridge` command is used to set the Bridge contract in your AppInbox on-chain. This is helpful as the AppInbox only accepts ticket requests for L1 to L2 bridging from the known Bridge contract. 

## Usage

```bash
npx @stackr/cli@latest add-bridge
```

## Output

You'll be prompted to enter your bridge address.
```bash [terminal]
? Bridge Contract Address
```
Enter the address and hit enter. 

If it passes all the checks 
```bash [terminal]
âœ” ðŸŒ‰ Succesfully added bridge contract to AppInbox
```
