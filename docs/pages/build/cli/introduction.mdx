# CLI [The entry point to Stackr SDK]

Stackr SDK comes with a CLI that allows you to interact with the SDK from the command line. The CLI is the entry point to the SDK and provides a set of commands to help you manage your projects.

It is written in TypeScript and can be installed globally using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install -g @stackr/sdk
```

Although we recommend using CLI using `npx` so that you always have the latest version of the CLI.

```bash
npx @stackr/sdk@latest
```

running this should display the help message for the CLI like this -

```bash
