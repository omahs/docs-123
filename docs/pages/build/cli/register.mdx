# `register` [Register your Micro-Rollup with Stackr]

The `register` command is used to add your Micro-Rollup to the Stackr on-chain registry.

:::info
**Few details to note**

- You don't need to register your application during development with the Stackr SDK.
- It's recommended to develop and test your application in [sandbox mode](/build/zero-to-one/run-it/#lets-run--sandbox-mode).
- It's recommended to register your application only once you are done with the development.
- After registration and deployment, if you make any changes to the genesis state or state machine code, you'd need to re-register and re-deploy your application.
:::

It performs the following 3 operations:

1. Reads the `stackr.config.ts` file for your project's configuration such as the operator account, registry contract address, L1 and Vulcan RPC URLs
2. Sends a transaction signed with the operator private key to Stackr's registry contract on the L1
3. The Stackr registry contract assigns a new app ID and deploys a new `AppInbox` contract for your micro-rollup. The operator address is also set as the owner of this contract.

:::tip
**AppInbox contract** üìù

The AppInbox contract on the L1 acts as the settlement contract for your micro-rollup chain. Some of its responsibilites:

- It is the source of truth for all critical information of your app such as the state machine hash, genesis state hash, current block height, current state root and more.
- The blocks produced by your app are periodically batched (in sequence) and sent to it for verification and settlement.
- It only accept blocks that are signed by the micro-rollup operator.

## Usage

```bash
¬ª stackr register --help
USAGE
  $ stackr register [--envFile <value>] [--privateKey <value>]

FLAGS
  --envFile=<value>     [default: .env] Path to the .env file
  --privateKey=<value>  Private key of the account to be used to register the contract

EXAMPLES
  $ stackr register

  $ stackr register --privateKey <privateKey> --envFile <path>
```

## Example

```bash
npx @stackr/cli@latest register
```

### Deployment cost

In addition to gas fees, the deployment cost for the `AppInbox` contract is 0.001 ETH. Make sure you have enough balance in your account to deploy the contract. This ETH is sent to the Vulcan operator.

We have kept this fees in this initial phase to prevent spamming and to ensure that the operator has enough funds to run the network.

:::info
The deployment fees is dynamic and increases with the number of applications deployed on the network. If the same app operator tries to deploy more than 10 applications, the fees will become 0.005 ETH for each new application.

### Output

```bash [terminal]
‚úî üìù Registered application on registry
‚úî üß∞ Updated deployment.json
```

Once the registration is successful, a new `deployment.json` file is created in the root of your project directory. This file looks like this:

```json [deployment.json]
{
  "appId": 18,
  "appInbox": "0x808c6cc1299A76ec3D1f6D37d1786801fF8d8f86",
  "chainId": 11155111
}
```
