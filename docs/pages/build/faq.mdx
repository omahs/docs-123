:::details[Who runs the Vulcan node?]
Currently, there is a single Vulcan node run by Stackr Labs to support the network.
Eventually, the Vulcan network will decentralise and anyone will permissionlessly be able to run Vulcan operators to serve Micro-Rollups at scale.

:::details[Can I host my Micro-Rollup on any cloud platform?]
Yes, in fact we encourage developers to host their Micro-Rollups after development and testing. Feel free to host it on anywhere from Railway to an EC2 instance.
Read our [Hosting guide](/build/guides/hosting) for more information.

:::details[Why is it taking so long to get C3A/C3B confirmation on my blocks?]
If you send in multiple blocks from your Micro-rollup, they will be ordered and rolled-up into a single block on Vulcan. Vulcan is configured to create batches every 6 hours or max blob size of chosen DA which ever comes first.
Therefore, subsequent blocks will take more time to get C3A/C3B confirmation.
It takes few minutes roughly how much time it takes to confirm data publication of the batch on a data availability layer.
After this, depending on Sepolia's network congestion, it may take 10-30s to submit the batch to your app's inbox and receive C3B confirmation.
