# FAQ [Frequency Asked Questions]

:::details[Who runs the Vulcan node?]
Currently, there is a single Vulcan node run by Stackr Labs to support the network.
Eventually, the Vulcan network will decentralise and anyone will permissionlessly be able to run Vulcan operators to serve Micro-Rollups at scale.

:::details[Can I host my Micro-Rollup on any cloud platform?]
Yes, in fact we encourage developers to host their Micro-Rollups after development and testing. Feel free to host it on anywhere from Railway to an EC2 instance.
Read our [Hosting guide](/build/guides/hosting) for more information.

:::details[Why is it taking so long to get C3A/C3B confirmation on my blocks?]
If you send in multiple blocks from your Micro-rollup, they will be ordered and rolled-up into a single block on Vulcan. Vulcan is configured to create batches every 6 hours or max blob size of chosen DA which ever comes first.
Therefore, subsequent blocks will take more time to get C3A/C3B confirmation.
It takes few minutes roughly how much time it takes to confirm data publication of the batch on a data availability layer.
After this, depending on Sepolia's network congestion, it may take 10-30s to submit the batch to your app's inbox and receive C3B confirmation.

:::details[Getting `trace trap` when using Bun?]
If you are getting `trace trap` error when using Bun. This is a known issue with Bun and SQLite, which got introduced in `v1.1.27` of bun. [More details here](https://discord.com/channels/876711213126520882/1282959007589601280/1283307017158791222).

They've fixed the issue in `v1.1.28` and you can upgrade by running:

```bash
bun upgrade
bun --version # check that you are on version >= 1.1.28
```

However, moving forward we recommend using `tsx` over `bun run` for running the MRU server. You may still use Bun for package management.
