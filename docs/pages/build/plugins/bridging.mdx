# Bridging [Getting data from L1]

The Stackr SDK offers L1 to L2 bridging out of the box through the `Bridge` Plugin. 

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts [index.ts]
// [!code word:Bridge]
import { Bridge } from "@stackr/sdk/plugins";

Bridge.init(rollup, {
    handlers: {
        // Define the bridging handler here. 
    }
})

```

## How it works? 
1. You can set a `bridge` contract in your micro-rollup's `AppInbox`.
2. The `AppInbox` has a `createTicket` function which can only be invoked by the bridge. 
3. When a ticket is created on the L1, the micro-rollup receives the event and processes the ticket. 

## Building your bridge

### 1. Write the Bridge contract
Developers can write their custom logic in the `Bridge` contract and interact with the `AppInbox` to create the `ticket` that'll be procsessed on the MRU.
```solidity [TokenBridge.sol]
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface ITicketFactory {
    function createTicket(
        bytes32 _identifier,
        address _msgSender,
        bytes memory _message
    ) external;
}

contract TokenBridge {
    address ticketFactory;

    constructor(address _ticketFactory) {
        ticketFactory = _ticketFactory;
    }

    function bridgeETH(address _to) external payable { // [!code focus]
        require(_to != address(0), "bridgeTokens/zero-address");
        require(msg.value > 0, "bridgeTokens/zero-amount");

        bytes memory message = abi.encode(_to, msg.value); // [!code focus]
        bytes32 identifier = keccak256("BRIDGE_ETH"); // [!code focus]

        ITicketFactory(ticketFactory).createTicket( // [!code focus]
            identifier, // [!code focus]
            msg.sender, // [!code focus]
            message // [!code focus]
        ); // [!code focus]
    }
}

```
The `bridgeETH` function —
1. Encodes the data to be sent to the micro-rollup. 
2. Computes an identifier for the ticket. This is important as this **identifier is used on the micro-rollup to match the ticket to a handler**. 
3. Creates the ticket by calling the `AppInbox` with the ticket `identifier`, `msg.sender`, and the `message` to be attached to the ticket.

### 2. Set the `Bridge` on the `AppInbox`.
Next up, you need to update the `AppInbox` to know which `Bridge` contract to accept ticket creation requests from. 

Run the CLI command:
```bash [terminal]
npx @stackr/cli add bridge
```

You'll be prompted with the bridge address:
```bash [terminal]
? Bridge Contract Address
```

Enter your bridge contract address above and you're set! The CLI will update the `Bridge` contract address inside the `AppInbox`.


### 3. Write the handler to process tickets
You can define a handler to process each different type of ticket. 

In our Bridge contract, we created a ticket with the identifier of `BRIDGE_ETH`. So, we need to write a handler to process the tickets with that specific identifier.

The function defined as a handler has to return —
1. `transitionName` - Name of the transition to trigger.
2. `action` - Action object that has the `inputs` to pass to the transition, `signature` of the MRU's operator on the inputs, and the `msgSender`.

```ts [index.ts]
Bridge.init(rollup, {
    handlers: {
        // [!code word: 'BRIDGE_ETH']
        'BRIDGE_ETH': async (args) => {
            const [_to, _amount] = abiCoder.decode(['address', 'uint'], args.data);
            const inputs = {
                address: _to,
                amount: Number(_amount)
            }
            const signature = await signMessage(operator, MintTokenSchema, inputs);
            
            const action = MintTokenSchema.actionFrom({ 
                inputs,
                signature,
                msgSender: operator.address
            })

            return {
                transitionName: 'mintToken',
                action: action
            }
        }
    }
})
```
The function to handle `BRIDGE_ETH` tickets —
1. First, decodes the data sent with the ticket. 
2. Generates the operator's signature on the data.
3. Creates an action to be submitted to the rollup.
4. Returns the `transitionName` and the `action`.

The micro-rollup then takes over and submits the returned action to the correct transition.

That's it! You've successfuly implemented bridging in your micro-rollup. You can extend this example to do arbitrary message passing. From arbitrary ERC-20 tokens to simply sending data to the rollup. 
For better understanding, we recommend going through the full codebase of the [bridge example](https://github.com/stackrlabs/micro-rollup-examples/tree/main/bridge).
