# Action [Basic interaction unit in an MRU]

Actions are the fundamental unit of interaction. They are the building block of a state machine that captures the user's input. These are analogous to transactions in a regular blockchain system with the difference that these are just signed messages that the users send to the micro-rollup.

Actions are used to trigger a state mutation in the MRU which is handled by the state transition function.

## Actions vs transactions

Actions are similar to transactions in a blockchain system. The key difference is that actions are not broadcasted to any network. They are just signed messages that the users send to the micro-rollup.
