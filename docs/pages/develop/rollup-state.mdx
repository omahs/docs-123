title: "Rollup State"
description: "Basis of Rollup for compute"

Stackr-JS comes with a base `RollupState` base class that can be extended to create a custom rollup.

```ts
import { RollupState } from "@stackr/stackr-js/execution";

export class FastestUTXORollup extends RollupState<
  StateVariable,
  StateTransport
> {}
```

:::info
You need to provide the `StateVariable` and `StateTransport` types to the
`RollupState` class which you defined previously.

:::

### Extending RollupState

You need to extend the `RollupState` class and implement 4 methods:

### `constructor`

You need to call the super constructor with the `StateVariable` type for it to be able to use the defined state

```ts
constructor(initialCount: StateVariable) {
    super(initialCount);
  }
```

### `createTransport`

This method is used to create a transport object that will be used to wrap a StateVariable.

:::code-group

```ts simpler
createTransport(state: StateVariable): StateTransport {
    return { currentCount: state };
  }

```

```ts simple
createTransport(accounts: accountsVariable): MerkleTreeTransport {
    const newTree = new BetterMerkleTree(state);
    return newTree;
  }
```

:::

### `getState`

This is the opposite of `createTransport` and is used to extract the state from a transport object.

:::code-group

```ts simpler
getState(transport: StateTransport): StateVariable {
    return transport.currentCount;
  }
```

```ts simple
getState(transport: MerkleTreeTransport): accountsVariable {
    return transport.leaves;
  }
```

:::

### `calculateRoot`

This method is used to calculate the state root of the rollup.
The idea behind is that the rollups must converge into single state root that is succint representation of the state of the rollup.

:::code-group

```ts simpler
calculateRoot(): ethers.BytesLike {
    return ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256(
      ["uint256"],
      [this.transport.currentCount]
    );
  }
```

```ts simple
calculateRoot(): ethers.BytesLike {
    return this.transport.merkleTree.getHexRoot();
  }
```

:::

### Final RollupState

Overall the final rollup state could look like this:

```ts
export class CounterRollup extends RollupState<StateVariable, StateTransport> {
  constructor(count: StateVariable) {
    super(count);
  }

  createTransport(state: StateVariable): StateTransport {
    return { currentCount: state };
  }

  getState(): StateVariable {
    return this.transport.currentCount;
  }

  calculateRoot(): ethers.BytesLike {
    return ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256(
      ["uint256"],
      [this.transport.currentCount]
    );
  }
}
```
