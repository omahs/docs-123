description: "Extending the use cases"

Micro-Rollup Object returns a bunch of useful utilities that can be used for interacting with it, getting more data out, or work on side-effects

You can access all of these as return values from the `microRollup` object

```ts
const { actions, state, chain, builder, syncer, events } = await MicroRollup({...})
```

### `actions`

Actions utility is used to both send an action to the micro-rollup and fetch an action from the micro-rollup. It exposed 3 methods

**`getSchema`**
returns the schema of the action

**`submit`**
submits an action to the micro-rollup

**`fetch`**
fetches an action from the micro-rollup using the action hash

usage example

```ts
const schema = await actions.getSchema();
const action = await actions.submit({ ... });
const action = await actions.fetch("0x...");
```

### `state`

You can access the latest state from within the micro-rollup using this function

**`get`**
returns the latest state

usage example

```ts
const state = await state.get();
```

### `chain`

You can access the current chain properties. There are 3 methods available

**`getCurrentHeight`**
returns the current height of the chain

**`getBlockByHeight`**
returns the block at a given height

**`getBlockByHash`**
returns the block at a given hash

usage example

```ts
const height = await chain.getCurrentHeight();
```

### `builder`

if you select `{autorun: false}` for builder you can manually build a batch of actions like this

```ts
await builder.tick();
```

### `syncer`

if you select `{autorun: false}` for syncer you can manually build a batch of actions like this

```ts
await syncer.sendBatch();
```

### `events`

Stackr uses a custom event emitters to notify of stuff happening behind the scenes like batching, execution etc.
You can leverage these events to build your own custom logic on top of the stackr engine

The available events are as follows:

```ts
export enum BuilderEvents {
  ORDER_BATCH = "order_batch",
}

export enum ActionEvents {
  SUBMIT_ACTION = "submit_action",
  FETCH_ACTION = "fetch_action",
}

export enum ExecutorEvents {
  EXECUTE_BATCH = "execute_batch",
  EXECUTE_SINGLE = "execute_single",
  UNPACK_ACTION = "unpack_action",
  ADVANCE_STATE = "advance_state",
}

export enum BatcherEvents {
  BATCH_ACTION = "batch_action",
}

export enum ConfirmationEvents {
  C0_CONFIRMATION = "c0_confirmation",
  C1_CONFIRMATION = "c1_confirmation",
  C2_CONFIRMATION = "c2_confirmation",
  C3_CONFIRMATION = "c3_confirmation",
}
```

These can be used like this

```ts
import { ActionEvents, BatcherEvents, BuilderEvents } from "@stackr/stackr-js";

events.action.onEvent(ActionEvents.SUBMIT_ACTION, (action) => {
  console.log("action submitted", action);
});

events.batcher.onEvent(BatcherEvents.BATCH_ACTION, (batch) => {
  console.log("action batched", batch);
});

events.builder.onEvent(BuilderEvents.ORDER_BATCH, (batch) => {
  console.log("action batch ordered", batch);
});
```

### For confimations

- C0 = Application receives the action and returns a "signed" acknowledgement
- C1 = Action that was included in a block gets executed
- C2 = The block was verified by Vulcan
- C3 = The block was posted on L1 by Vulcan

```ts
// C0_CONFIRMATION
events.confirmation.onEvent(ConfirmationEvents.C0_CONFIRMATION, (data) => {
  // Access these values from data
  //
  // actionHash
  // msgSender
  // signature
  // payload
  // acknowledgement
});

// C1_CONFIRMATION
events.confirmation.onEvent(ConfirmationEvents.C1_CONFIRMATION, (data) => {
  // Access these values from data
  //
  // actionHash
  // msgSender
  // signature
  // payload
  // state
});

// C2_CONFIRMATION
events.confirmation.onEvent(ConfirmationEvents.C2_CONFIRMATION, (data) => {
  // Access these values from data
  //
  // block
});

// C3_CONFIRMATION
events.confirmation.onEvent(ConfirmationEvents.C3_CONFIRMATION, (data) => {
  // Access these values from data
  //
  // blockhash
});
```
