This is how the `stackr.config.ts` file looks like

<Info>Everything is explained in the comments, please read through</Info>

```ts
import { KeyPurpose, SignatureScheme, StackrConfig } from "@stackr/stackr-js";

// this file is generated by the deployment script
import * as deployment from "./deployment.json";

const stackrConfig: StackrConfig = {
  // your micro-rollup's identity
  stackrApp: {
    // the app id for your micro-rollup as returned by the deployment script
    appId: deployment.app_id,

    // the deployment script also deploys an app inbox for you where the rollup data is stored
    appInbox: deployment.app_inbox,
  },
  // the builder is responsible for building the rollup blocks
  builder: {
    // the batchSize is the number of transactions that will be included in a rollup block
    // this is the MAX but the actual number of transactions in a block can be lower
    // in case some transactions are invalid
    batchSize: 10,

    // the batchTime is the time in milliseconds after which a rollup block will be built
    batchTime: 1000,
  },
  // the syncer is responsible for syncing the rollup blocks to the L1 and Vulcan layer
  syncer: {
    // this is the time after which the syncer will send blocks to vulcan layer for verification
    slotTime: 5000,

    // self-explanatory :)
    vulcanRPC: "http://vulcan.stf.xyz",
    L1RPC: "http://rpc.stf.xyz",
  },
  // the operator is responsible for signing the rollup blocks
  // and setting up onchain contracts
  operator: {
    accounts: [
      {
        // this is the private key of the operator
        privateKey: "PUT_A_KEY",

        // Dont worry about it, we kinda over-engineered this part :)
        purpose: KeyPurpose.BATCH,
        scheme: SignatureScheme.ECDSA,
      },
    ],
  },
  // EIP-712 domain details used for signing and verifying transactions
  domain: {
    name: "Put something here",
    version: "1",
    chainId: 69420,
    verifyingContract: deployment.app_inbox,
    salt: "put something here",
  },

  // the datastore is used to store the rollup details
  datastore: {
    // changing this does nothing lol, it's hardcoded, we will update it later
    filePath: "./datastore",
  },
};

export { stackrConfig };
```
