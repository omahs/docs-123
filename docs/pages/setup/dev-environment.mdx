# Installation [Prepare your development environment]

The first step to start developing Micro-Rollups with Stackr is to prepare your development environment and making sure that all the system requirements are upto date and matches the required versions.

## Install BunJS

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you have the latest version of Bun installed that supports
  decorators >= 1.0.15
</Callout>

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

More information regarding Bun can be found at https://bun.sh

## Install Rust

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend using Linux or macOS for development. If you are using Windows,
  you can install WSL2 and use Linux.
</Callout>

For Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Install `Stackr-CLI`

CLI helps you to create new projects, compile and deploy your micro-rollups.

For Mac ARM based chips:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://stackr-cli-bin.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/stackr-mac.sh | bash
```

For Linux :

```bash
sudo apt install gcc libssl-dev -y #Installs dependencies
curl -fsSL https://stackr-cli-bin.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/stackr-linux.sh | bash
```

And for all other systems

Rust installation comes with `cargo` package manager. We can also use cargo to install `stackr-cli`.

```bash
cargo install stackr
```

## Install Javy

Directly install the binary for Mac with

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/releases/download/v1.2.0/javy-arm-macos-v1.2.0.gz | gunzip > javy && chmod +x javy && sudo mv javy /usr/local/bin/
```

For Linux,

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/releases/download/v1.2.0/javy-x86_64-linux-v1.2.0.gz | gunzip > javy && chmod +x javy && sudo mv javy /usr/local/bin/
```

This command asks for root permissions to move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`. Open a new terminal tab or source your shell to make sure the command runs.

```bash
javy --version
```

For other archs/platforms, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy/releases) page and `curl` the appropriate URL.

This is the recommended approach. However, if it does not work, please build Javy from source.

- On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install curl pkg-config libssl-dev clang`
- `wasm32-wasi`, can be installed via `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`
- `cmake`, depending on your operating system and architecture, it might not be installed by default. On MacOS it can be installed with homebrew via `brew install cmake`. - On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install cmake`.
- Rosetta 2 if running MacOS on Apple Silicon, can be installed via `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`

Then clone the repo and install `javy` cli globally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytecodealliance/javy.git && cd javy
cargo build -p javy-core --target=wasm32-wasi -r
cargo install --path crates/cli
javy --version
```

## Install git

You probably already have g(it).
