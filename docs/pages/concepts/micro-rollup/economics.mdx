## Hybrid model

<img src="/assets/network-economy.png" alt="Hybrid economy" />

The unique hybrid nature of Stackr introduces an innovative network economics structure, blending elements of both Web2 and Web3 economic models. 
In this setup, the application and end users form one group, while the application and auditors constitute another. 
These economic models can operate independently. 
- The application may charge users through a Web2-style API or subscription pricing model based on usage and feature access, resembling existing web2 business models. 
- While auditors can levy a verification fees on the application, depending on the volume of data and cost of compute required for verification via a gas metering system or some other format.
In a decentralised network of auditors, the verification fees will converge to globally competitive market rates, thereby offering a cost-effective and efficient verification service.
