### Bun

We have been utilizing some of the capabilities of Bun, so it is a required dependency for now.

:::info
Make sure you have the latest version of Bun installed (i.e >= `1.0.15`)
:::

```sh copy
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

More information regarding Bun can be found at https://bun.sh

### Installations

You need to have access to the Stackr packages, if you don't have that refer to the [Getting Access](/zero-to-one/getting-access) section.

CLI helps you to create, register and deploy your micro-rollups.
Either you can install it globally using

:::code-group
 
```bash [npm]
npm i -g @stackr/cli
```
 
```bash [bun]
bun i -g @stackr/cli
```
:::

OR 

you can run the commands without installing

:::code-group
 
```bash [npm]
npx @stackr/cli
```
 
```bash [bun]
bunx @stackr/cli
```
