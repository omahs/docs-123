# Checking WASM binary

Stackr builds a WASM binary of your State Machine and stores it in `stackr_build/stf.wasm`. You can check the binary using the `wasmtime` or similar tools.

In this example, we will use `wasmtime` to check the binary.

## Install Wasmtime

```bash [Terminal]
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

## Run Wasmtime

We give an object consisting of an array of actions and currentState to the Stackr State Machine (SSM) which then applies these actions and returns the next state.

The easiest way to check that the SSM is valid is to give it an array of empty actions and a 'currentState' which could be the state object in your 'genesis-state.json' (`0` in case of counter).
It should then return the same state as no actions were applied.

```bash [Terminal]
echo '{"actions":[],"currentState": 0 }' | wasmtime stackr_build/stf.wasm
```

and you should see the output as:
```bash [Terminal]
0
```

Anything else in the output means that the WASM binary is not working as expected or failed to compile.
