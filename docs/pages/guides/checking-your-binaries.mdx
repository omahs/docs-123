# Checking WASM binary

Stackr builds a WASM binary of your State Machine and stores it in `stackr_build/stf.wasm`. You can check the binary using the `wasmtime` or similar tools.

In this example, we will use `wasmtime` to check the binary.

## Install Wasmtime

```bash [Terminal]
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

## Run Wasmtime

We give an object to the State Machine and it returns an output. Easiest way to check this is give your machine a `previousState` which is your `initialState` (`0` in case of counter) and see if it returns the `finalState`.

```bash [Terminal]
echo '{"actions":[],"currentState": 0 }' | wasmtime stackr_build/stf.wasm
```

and you should see the output as:
```bash [Terminal]
0
```

Anything else in the output means that the WASM binary is not working as expected or failed to compile.
