# What to build with Stackr? [Ideas and wishlists]

## Why build your app as a micro-rollup?

You can be on two ends of the spectrum. You’re either building your protocol as smart contracts inside the constraints of a virtual machine or you’re building a centralised app.

Building on a micro-rollup can bring apps on either ends of the spectrum to ✨ sufficient decentralisation ✨

Think of a micro-rollup as a sufficiently decentralised backend for your app, where you, the builder, can decide where do you wanna stay on the spectrum of decentralisation.

On top of that, when building with a micro-rollup, you instantly unlock —

- On-chain composability.
- Verifiable Compute.
- Faster finality compared to smart contracts.

## Project Ideas

_Micro-rollups are foundational building blocks with which you can build a wide range of applications. Below are a few verticals where we think interesting use-cases are waiting to be discovered._

### Account Abstraction & Intents

The account abstraction space is nascent and has emerging standards and infrastructures for the stack. A fair bit of the AA world can be built on micro-rollups!

- Solver Marketplace
- Decentralised Bundler
- Micro-Rollup based smart accounts
- [Unified Mempool](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/unified-erc-4337-mempool)

### Reputation Systems

Micro-rollups are great at ingesting data and performing compute over them. Why? Because it’s all verifiable on-chain. Building a reputation system of any kind with a micro-rollup can help significantly reduce the amount of trust on the app and make your system sufficiently decentralised.

- Points!
- Engagement Score on social graphs like Farcaster.
- Credit Score for DeFi activity.

### Embedded Social Apps (/Frames)

With the introduction of Frames, you can now embed your applications inside a social media feed. The embedded applications still require a backend to power them, and a micro-rollup is a perfect fit for several use-cases.

- Games
  - YOINK!
  - Dungeon Wars
- P2P Swaps
- Polls
- NFT mints
- Token distribution

### General

And there’s a whole lot more that can be built with micro-rollups, below are the select picks from the team that we want to see get built!

- Orderbook-based DEX
- Dynamic NFTs
- Privacy apps
- Prediction Markets
- Lending Protocol
