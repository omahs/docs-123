# Sufficient Decentralization [Decentralization is a spectrum]

At the heart of sufficient decentralisation is the recognition that complete decentralisation, while ideal in theory, may not be practical or necessary for all aspects of an application. Instead, developers are encouraged to identify and decentralise critical components of their applications, thereby achieving a hybrid model that combines the best of both worlds. This approach not only enhances efficiency and user experience but also ensures the integrity and security of the applicationâ€™s core functions.

We recently wrote an elaborate article on this topic [What everyone\* gets wrong about building blockchain apps](https://mirror.xyz/stackrlabs.eth/PCLh7XSEkx4d2cZURXREKxQlvd4u3N2RzNJFhIE_SWs).

## Stackr's approach

Stackr borrows a lot of ideas from the philosophy of sufficient decentralization. The primary objective is to optimize for UX while keeping "enough" things decentralized.
