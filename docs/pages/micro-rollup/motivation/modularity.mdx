# Modularity [Build whatever, using whatever]

Stackr is a modular system, you can use whatever you want. We firmly believe that developers should use the best tools at their disposal to get the job done and not because a certain framework forces them to use something.

## Modular by design

External dependencies like sequencing, data availibility, settlement etc are customizable by the developers and they can choose to use anything they wish in the form of hot swappable modules. Stackr does not wish to lock the developers into a particular ecosystem and provides the ability to mix and match different tech stacks.
