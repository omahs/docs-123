# Microservices [Micro-rollups brings microservices to web3]

## What is a microservice?

A microservice is a small, self-contained unit of functionality that can be deployed independently. Microservices are typically used to break down a large application into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each microservice is responsible for a specific task or set of tasks, and communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs.

## Micro-Rollups are inspired by Microservices

Micro-rollups are deeply inspired by microservices. Each micro-rollup runs a small, self-contained rollup chain that can be deployed independently. They focus on running one service very efficiently and can be composed together to create more complex applications.

## Interoperability

To achieve the level of interoperability that microservices have, micro-rollups will need to have a common protocol for communication. This interface will allow micro-rollups to communicate with each other in a standardized way.

This mechanism is baked deep into Stackr and will help different micro-rollups to share data and communicate with each other. More on this soon.
