# Single-App Rollups [Micro-Rollups are for standalone apps]

Micro-rollups are oprimized for **single-app rollups**. By providing each application with its dedicated rollup, this approach effectively removes the battle for shared state, thus alleviating congestion and minimizing transaction fees.

The core advantages of micro-rollups lie in their support for modular development and their ability to scale.

### Custom-Designed for Specific Applications

Micro-rollups are specifically tailored for individual applications, simplifying development and allowing for rapid adaptation and feature integration.

### Inherent Interoperability

Built with standardized communication protocols, micro-rollups facilitate seamless interactions between different applications, avoiding ecosystem silos.

### Unlimited Innovation in System Design

Focused on bespoke execution environments, they enable the use of a broader range of programming languages and development approaches, fostering innovation.

### Elimination of State Growth Concerns

By isolating application states, micro-rollups efficiently manage data, preventing unsustainable state growth and ensuring long-term scalability.

### Enhanced Modularity

Their architecture promotes flexibility, allowing for easy integration, technology adoption, and functionality customization, which accelerates development and adapts to evolving needs.
