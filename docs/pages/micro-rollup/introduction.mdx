# Micro Rollups [A New Paradigm for building Blockchain Applications]

## Definition

Micro-Rollups (MRUs) represent a cutting-edge framework designed to facilitate off-chain execution of complex logic, while ensuring the integrity and verifiability of such executions on the blockchain. This approach not only enhances the scalability and efficiency of applications but also maintains the trustless nature of blockchain technologies.

They are designed as stateful, autonomous, and self-hosted execution environments that prioritize high execution throughput. The responsibility for verifying these executions is transferred to an external layer, known as "Vulcan," which validates the state updates and ensures the computed data is accurately recorded on the blockchain.

## Key Concepts

**1. Stateful Operations**

MRUs are designed to maintain and update a persistent state based on user interactions. This means they can handle and store data, ranging from simple variables to complex data structures, evolving as users interact with the application.

**2. Self-contained**

Designed to be self-contained, MRUs can operate autonomously. They encapsulate all the necessary components and logic to function without relying on external systems, making them versatile for a wide range of applications.

**3. Flexibility in Hosting**

MRUs offer the flexibility to be hosted across various environments, be it a local server, cloud infrastructure, or even decentralized platforms, ensuring they can be deployed in the most suitable environment for their intended use.

**4. Versatile Execution Environments**

The framework allows MRUs to be developed in diverse programming languages, starting with Typescript and expanding to others, accommodating the preferences and expertise of different developers.

**5. Broad logic Execution**

MRUs are capable of executing a wide array of logic defined by developers, from basic computations to intricate algorithms, enabling the creation of diverse applications with state-based interactions.

**6. Delegated Verification**

The obligation to prove the accuracy of state updates does not fall on Micro-Rollups (MRUs). Instead, MRUs operate within an environment that is either fully or partially trusted, executing logic efficiently. The task of validating these state updates is assigned to Vulcan, which scrutinizes their correctness before finalizing the data on a parent blockchain.

This division of responsibilities allows MRUs to maintain a lightweight and rapid execution model, as they are relieved from the burden of generating proofs for state updates.

## Blockchain Augmentation

Micro-Rollups can seamlessly augment blockchain functionality, effectively bridging the gap between traditional web2 backend systems and blockchain-based applications. This integration ensures that neither developers nor users need to be concerned with the underlying complexities of blockchain technology. Developers can craft their application logic in a familiar manner, akin to traditional backend development, while leveraging the decentralized, secure, and verifiable nature of blockchains.

## Decentralized Backends for Modern Applications

MRUs act as decentralized backends, capturing every state-changing interaction and coordinating with the Vulcan layer for verification. This process ensures that all updates are accurately reflected and secured on the blockchain, marrying the efficiency and user experience of web2 with the trustless, transparent nature of web3 technologies.

By doing so, MRUs offer a powerful tool for developers to create robust, scalable, and secure applications without the overhead traditionally associated with blockchain development.
