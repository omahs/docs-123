# Execution Layer [aka Application Layer]

The execution layer hosts the main application logic. This environment delivers a developer experience akin to traditional server-side or backend application development.

MRUs deliver exceptionally high throughput, mirroring the instant interaction users expect from web2 applications. Upon receiving a userâ€™s request, the application promptly attempts to execute the state changes. If successful, it instantly provides feedback to the user. Subsequently, in according to MRU configurations, the application dispatches the block containing the state update and the corresponding actions to the Vulcan layer. This layer is responsible for verifying the accuracy of the transactions before ultimately recording the data on the blockchain.
