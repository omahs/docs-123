# Overview [The Stackr Stack]

Stackr provides an opinionated framework for building Micro-rollups (MRUs) in general purpose languages. It takes rollup development to its core elements: operating a state machine off-chain, logging incoming transactions, processing these transactions to update the state, and ultimately recording the state roots and transaction proofs on the parent blockchain.

The architecture of MRUs is composed of two distinct layers -

1. Execution Layer
2. Verification Layer
