# Beta Access [ Get access to tools for developing MRUs ]

## Before you proceed

Understand that this is a highly experimental framework and not recommended for production use. There are some gotchas to keep in mind:

1. The objective of this beta release is to gather feedback and improve the framework.
2. The SDK and CLI are still under development and may have regular breaking changes.
3. The framework is not yet optimized for gas efficiency and may have high gas costs initially when settling rollup blocks. It may range from 200k to 300k gas per block.
4. **The L1 and DA settlement cost as well as verification fees is currently sponsored by Stackr and may change in the future.**
5. The framework is yet audited and may have security vulnerabilities.

Please help us by providing feedback and reporting any issues you encounter. We are committed to making the framework better and more secure. ðŸ«¡

## Signup for access

<Callout type="success">
  The form is powered by a Micro-Rollup on Sepolia! Checkout its
  [AppInbox](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x72970B499489F535a00c63F9f75B438F4BA01037#events)
</Callout>

You can request beta access to the Stackr's SDK and CLI by filling up this form and signing up for the beta program. The beta runs on Sepolia and it is recommended to have funds on the Sepolia testnet to deploy Stackr Micro-Rollups.

On getting access, you will be added the Stackr's NPM Org and you can install the SDK and CLI using NPM.

:::warning
This account will be used for deploying Micro-rollups and signing on L2 blocks. Make sure you have access to its private key.

## Getting NPM access token

Make sure you are added to the Stackr's NPM Org before continuing.

```bash [Terminal]
npm login
```

This will generate a file called `.npmrc` in your home directory. You can find it at `~/.npmrc`

Copy the generated token from a line which looks like this in the `.npmrc` file

```yaml [.npmrc]
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=<GENERATED_TOKEN>
```

## Add package scope to your bun config

:::info
As of now, Bun doesn't read the `.npmrc` file to get the token. You need to add the token to the bun config file.
:::

Create `bunfig.toml` in your root

```bash [Terminal]
touch ~/.bunfig.toml
```

edit the `.bunfig.toml` file and add the following lines with the generated token

```toml [.bunfig.toml]
[install.scopes]
"@stackr" = { token = "<GENERATED_TOKEN>", url = "https://registry.npmjs.com/" }
```

For Details, you can refer to [Bun's Scopes and Registries](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)

Now you're all set to start rollin' with Stackr âš¡
