# Beta Access [ Get access to tools to develop MRUs ]

You can request beta access to the Stackr's SDK and CLI filling up this form and signing up for the beta program. Over Sepolia Network.

<ConnectWallet />

## Getting NPM access token

Make sure you are added to the Stackr's NPM Org before continuing.

```bash [Terminal]
npm login
```

This will generate a file called `.npmrc` in your home directory. You can find it at `~/.npmrc`

Copy the generated token from a line which looks like this in the `.npmrc` file

```yaml [.npmrc]
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=<GENERATED_TOKEN>
```

## Add package scope to your bun config

:::info
As of now, Bun doesn't read the `.npmrc` file to get the token. You need to add the token to the bun config file.
:::

Create `bunfig.toml` in your root

```bash [Terminal]
touch ~/.bunfig.toml
```

edit the `.bunfig.toml` file and add the following lines with the generated token

```toml [.bunfig.toml]
[install.scopes]
"@stackr" = { token = "<GENERATED_TOKEN>", url = "https://registry.npmjs.com/" }
```

For Details, you can refer to [Bun's Scopes and Registries](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)
